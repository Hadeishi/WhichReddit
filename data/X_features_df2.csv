2,slabby,1527645994.0,8n4ui3,37,datascience,"I don't know what subreddit is best for this post. Sorry if it's not this one.

So I'm a data analyst, not a data scientist. I just finished grad school (not data science) and I'm between jobs and about to move to a new city, so I've been taking the last few weeks to go through Datacamp's material fairly intensely (~4 hours a day) to upgrade my skills before I get my hopes and dreams crushed by the job market.

...


The **first** thing I noticed about Datacamp was that they did a lot of stuff *for* me. I'd open up an exercise and most of the code had been written already, with a couple of spaces with '____' where I should fill in the right answer. I thought this was really frustrating, because there was never any point in the process where they explained to me why we needed to perform whatever operation it was. I'm like 50 hours in, and I'm not sure I could do any of this without Datacamp's prompting. I think this is the worst part of the Datacamp curriculum. I feel that I'm paying Datacamp to teach me Python syntax and when to use it (not just how to use it), and I feel like I'm not learning either of those things.

**Second,** although Datacamp courses offer short video segments that putatively ""teach"" the course, the exercises were essentially big text boxes. Oftentimes the video and text would be somewhat out of sync, and sometimes it felt like entire sections had been omitted between text and video. This made watching the videos almost completely optional, and considering most of them are shorter than 5 min, there was never enough time to substantively introduce the material anyway.

**Third**, the exercises rarely feel practical. There are some nice real-world datasets used, but because of what I describe in my first paragraph, it's hard to actually interface with them. You're not really working with them yourself. Beyond that, it doesn't feel like Datacamp spends a lot of time trying to motivate the problem. Why do we need to take this approach, etc. There are often domain-specific considerations that influence how the problem may best be solved, and that stuff is completely omitted. This ends up meaning that these supposedly practical exercises end up anything but.

I had a really long paragraph here about how **I dislike their two-part statistics course**. TL;DR: I thought the treatment of linear regression was really shallow and incomplete (there's no mention of residuals at all, for example), and I thought leaving out multiple and logistic regression meant it didn't provide enough for students to actually learn how to work with data. I've never worked as a data scientist, but I understand that those two are important. They're already super useful as an analyst.

**That's not to say that Datacamp is terrible.** I really liked some of the data viz stuff they've got (Seaborn and Bokeh are awesome), and I think their first couple of intro to Python courses are helpful. I've heard great things about their R courses, as well. And Datacamp has got a great platform for what they're doing.

I'm certainly going to finish my month of Datacamp, but I don't think I'll be resubscribing. I know it's kind of a cheap shot, but I feel like I might subscribe to one of their competitor products in the hope that they can teach me more of the syntax and thought process behind this stuff. I'm disappointed to be paying somebody to teach me, only to have to Google what they're supposed to be teaching.My Review: Unimpressed with Datacamp (for Python)",know subreddit best post sorry one data analyst data scientist finished grad school data science jobs move new city taking last weeks go datacamp material fairly intensely hours day upgrade skills get hopes dreams crushed job market first thing noticed datacamp lot stuff open exercise code written already couple spaces fill right answer thought really frustrating never point process explained needed perform whatever operation like hours sure could without datacamp prompting think worst part datacamp curriculum feel paying datacamp teach python syntax use use feel like learning either things second although datacamp courses offer short video segments putatively teach course exercises essentially big text boxes oftentimes video text would somewhat sync sometimes felt like entire sections omitted text video made watching videos almost completely optional considering shorter min never enough time substantively introduce material anyway third exercises rarely feel practical nice real world datasets used describe first paragraph hard actually interface really working beyond feel like datacamp spends lot time trying motivate problem need take approach etc often domain specific considerations influence problem may best solved stuff completely omitted ends meaning supposedly practical exercises end anything really long paragraph dislike two part statistics course tl dr thought treatment linear regression really shallow incomplete mention residuals example thought leaving multiple logistic regression meant provide enough students actually learn work data never worked data scientist understand two important already super useful analyst say datacamp terrible really liked data viz stuff got seaborn bokeh awesome think first couple intro python courses helpful heard great things r courses well datacamp got great platform certainly going finish month datacamp think resubscribing know kind cheap shot feel like might subscribe one competitor products hope teach syntax thought process behind stuff disappointed paying somebody teach google supposed teaching review unimpressed datacamp python

13,seacucumber3000,1527615616.0,8n1141,1,datascience,"So I posted a similar question last week, but the title was a little more vague. I'm pretty stuck on what to do, and I want to get this project finished ASAP.

I'm working on a project involving looking at windows of two data sets and, by shifting the one of the windows relative to the other, finding both the best correlation value and its associated shift.

The professor/researcher I'm working with asked if there's a way to ensure that there is enough variance between the two datasets to ensure good quality correlation values between the two sets (since windows with little variance can be correlated well at many different shifts). I wasn't sure of a way to do this, so I'm curious what the best way to do this is.

I'm also curious if you guys know of any other techniques to use ensure quality correlation and shift values for the windows.

Here's a longer write-up of the program:

Given two datasets of two years worth of data each:

1. Select the first 24-hour window for each dataset
2. Skip the window if it contains &gt;25% NaN
3. Resample the windows to 1-minute data (previously 15-second and 30-second data)
4. For a range (initially -100 minutes to 100 minutes) calculate the correlation, save correlation and shift to arrays, then move on to the next value in the range
5. Select the highest correlation and its associated shift
6. Resample the data into 30-minute windows (requirement according to researcher/prof. I'm working with)
7. Re-calculate the correlation at the best shift with the 30-minute window
8. Set the bounds in 4 to the (shift - 10 minutes) and (the shift + 10 minutes)
9. Output the new correlation and the shift
10. Repeat step one for a window shifted over 30 minutes

The data is from two spacecraft at a distance known only to be within a range. Since we're looking at the data from both, we need to match up the data in windows with a shift since the data recorded from one spacecraft is delayed respective to the other.

With the massive amounts of data, it's looking like the entire analysis will take ~5 hours (which I guess isn't too bad), but I'm hoping there are other ways to speed it up. I was originally doing each window calculation for the entire -100 minutes to +100 minutes range, but then I realized that the shift from window to window should be under 10 minutes difference compared to the prior window, so I can set bounds and not have to calculate unnecessary shifts (if that makes sense). It also ensures the shifts to be close to each other, since I was having issues with a few windows having drastically different shifts.

I hope that all makes sense! I'm 99% done with the program, it just needs some minor polishing like this, imo.How to ensure there is enough variance in two datasets to correlate",posted similar question last week title little vague pretty stuck want get project finished asap working project involving looking windows two data sets shifting one windows relative finding best correlation value associated shift professor researcher working asked way ensure enough variance two datasets ensure good quality correlation values two sets since windows little variance correlated well many different shifts sure way curious best way also curious guys know techniques use ensure quality correlation shift values windows longer write program given two datasets two years worth data select first hour window dataset skip window contains gt nan resample windows minute data previously second second data range initially minutes minutes calculate correlation save correlation shift arrays move next value range select highest correlation associated shift resample data minute windows requirement according researcher prof working calculate correlation best shift minute window set bounds shift minutes shift minutes output new correlation shift repeat step one window shifted minutes data two spacecraft distance known within range since looking data need match data windows shift since data recorded one spacecraft delayed respective massive amounts data looking like entire analysis take hours guess bad hoping ways speed originally window calculation entire minutes minutes range realized shift window window minutes difference compared prior window set bounds calculate unnecessary shifts makes sense also ensures shifts close since issues windows drastically different shifts hope makes sense done program needs minor polishing like imo ensure enough variance two datasets correlate
14,seoulonfire,1527626704.0,8n2jhv,4,datascience,"So I have a categorical feature in a dataset that has 9000 unique values where a row may look something like below:

`['Pheochromocytoma', 'Gastrointestinal_stroma_tumor', 'Hereditary_cancer-predisposing_syndrome', 'Paragangliomas_4']`

This is obviously relevant information that I'd like to use in a model, but I'm stumped as to what the best way to go about handling a feature like this is, where one row contains multiple different values basically. They also vary in length: one rows list may contain any number of values.

My first thought is to split at the commas and create a new column for each unique value, but the coding logistics on how to achieve that across a big dataset where the values vary quite a bit start to get fuzzy real quick. Plus, this could start to create a massive feature set, where my goal currently is to reduce it. That's not as big of an issue though, as if it needs to be done that way, it needs to be done that way.

28,GrundleMoof,1527379874.0,8me876,15,datascience,"Hey all. So I'm doing Kaggle competitions and by far one of the most common modeling techniques you see is ensemble stacking. I get the *general* idea of it, I think. You take multiple models, have them each learn on subsets of the train data, and then combine their results \(i.e., their predictions of those subsets\) such that a higher level model figures out which of those models to use for different types of samples.

30,NoxDS,1527349624.0,8mazg7,5,datascience,"Like many of the other posters here, I'm trying to gather some advice and information on a potential career change to data science. I have Ph.D. in Cognitive/Human Factors Psychology and have a fairly strong background in experimental design, statistics, and modeling, but a weak background in programming.  

I wrote Visual Basic scripts for all of my experiments and was considered a ""good"" programmer for my department, but that isn't saying much. I would need to learn the more widely used languages in DS, but that doesn't scare me as much as I'm sure it would a future employer.  

My stats background is much better, I was fortunate to have good stats professors that valued theoretical understanding of data analysis, so I know not just what tests to run but why and the potential pitfalls. A lot of my Ph.D. work involved signal-detection theory and used nonlinear regression, MDS, PAC, non-parametric tests, etc. My SAS and Matlab knowledge is average, but I'm proficient with SPSS. I'm familiar with ML, but not versed in it (it was never a focus, though my research was largely in Human-Computer Interaction).  

I did a search for similar topics on this sub and unlike most of those posters, I'm not fresh out of grad school, which adds another twist. I've been working as a consultant at an engineering firm for about 4 years. Most of my job is to identify the causal human factors involved in accidents and provide expert testimony. I really don't do any programming nor do I really use statistics in this job, but it has improved my soft skills (project management, writing, dealing with tight deadlines, working on interdisciplinary teams, managing and supervising, client presentations, communication skills).  

So my questions really are... what sort of position might value my experience and background? Is there any type of topics, areas, or keywords I should be looking for (or should stay away from)?  I've been doing a ton of reading on crash courses, bootcamps, etc, and my fear is that if I will waste my time on topics which shouldn't be my focus. For example, I don't want to learn 5 programming languages if the end result is me trying (and failing) to sell myself as a faux computer scientist. I'd like to try and emphasize my strengths while using my time and energy to fill holes.

I've been trying to wrap my head around how this method could possibly be improved, if at all possible.

But anyway, it runs a cost benefit analysis on your tasks and then you get a nice weighted column of what you should work on first. I mean you’d have to tweak it. The formula I used was Importance of Task ÷ \(Duration in hours × Value of your time\) \+ Cost. You have to figure out what your time is worth. I think if you figure out your hourly rate at your job, that’s a good number to use. In other words if you average $50 hour, you say “If I weren’t doing this task that takes 1 hour, I could be making $50” 

This is is also a good way to figure out if you should do a job yourself or outsource it. If it takes you an hour to cut your lawn but you can get some neighborhood kid to do it for $20, it’s a better use of your resources to outsource it.

The professor/researcher I'm working with asked if there's a way to ensure that there is enough variance between the two datasets to ensure good quality correlation values between the two sets (since windows with little variance can be correlated well at many different shifts). I wasn't sure of a way to do this, so I'm curious what the best way to do this is.

I'm also curious if you guys know of any other techniques to use ensure quality correlation and shift values for the windows.

Here's a longer write-up of the program:

Given two datasets of two years worth of data each:

1. Select the first 24-hour window for each dataset
2. Skip the window if it contains &gt;25% NaN
3. Resample the windows to 1-minute data (previously 15-second and 30-second data)
4. For a range (initially -100 minutes to 100 minutes) calculate the correlation, save correlation and shift to arrays, then move on to the next value in the range
5. Select the highest correlation and its associated shift
6. Resample the data into 30-minute windows (requirement according to researcher/prof. I'm working with)
7. Re-calculate the correlation at the best shift with the 30-minute window
8. Set the bounds in 4 to the (shift - 10 minutes) and (the shift + 10 minutes)
9. Output the new correlation and the shift
10. Repeat step one for a window shifted over 30 minutes

The data is from two spacecraft at a distance known only to be within a range. Since we're looking at the data from both, we need to match up the data in windows with a shift since the data recorded from one spacecraft is delayed respective to the other.

With the massive amounts of data, it's looking like the entire analysis will take ~5 hours (which I guess isn't too bad), but I'm hoping there are other ways to speed it up. I was originally doing each window calculation for the entire -100 minutes to +100 minutes range, but then I realized that the shift from window to window should be under 10 minutes difference compared to the prior window, so I can set bounds and not have to calculate unnecessary shifts (if that makes sense). It also ensures the shifts to be close to each other, since I was having issues with a few windows having drastically different shifts.

For my internship I work on a scoring subject. I have to score customers on their behaviour regarding emails (will they open the mail or not ?). Basically, my dependent variable is the event 'Mail is opened'

My data contains several variables that describe :

- The content of the mail

I found some drawbacks from this method :
- Customer must have received enough mails
- What if there is a new product ? There will be no training data regarding the new product

I wrote a previous processing script in python to try to do this work (interrelating columns, normalizing/geocoding where possible, some NLP stuff, etc.) but obviously it's time intensive and each additional dataset requires customization.

As i feel this is a common task, is there a more drag-and-drop/non-code intensive tool that helps to expedite this process? It can be enterprise.

Thanks!

I.e. if you send IOS, mobile, Orange carrier in Spain, the traffic will primarily go to offer Y. If you send Android, Tablet in France it will go to offer X etc. I assume they optimize for earning per view/click. A fraction will be for testing, but the majority of the traffic will go to the optimal offer.

I wonder what the general workings of such algorithms are, and if there's a place (research papers, or books), I can learn more about this type of problem? I have a hard time finding anything directly related online, as it's not a very common problem in research papers, and a lot of the algorithms are being disclosed -- all though some mention using Bayesian statistics to optimize.

I started looking at multi-armed bandit problems, which I feel are very close to this type of problem. If you imagine the different offers are different ""bandits"", which bandit should you choose to maximize return. From this they can calculate a percentage weight per offer. Maybe initially they will all start at an even weight, and once there's enough data in the timespan, the weights will be shuffled (at a timed basis, i.e. every 30 min). 

I think this is a very interesting problem, as I work in online marketing and also study computer science.

I've been interested in the data science field since last summer and have started taking it seriously this summer. I'm in the final year of my PhD \(chemical engineering\) and I'm trying to come up with a plan for what to do. My PhD is relatively un\-stressful \(atypical, but find yourself an australian adviser if you want this life\) so I have a decent amount of time to devote to this. Since my project is highly experimental, I have a decent amount of experience coding in matlab doing image processing but not much else.

I graduate Spring 2019 \(timing is flexible\). I'd like to self teach as much as I can and be a competitive applicant for the PhD fellowships that are offered by Insight and Data Incubator. My current plan is as follows:

1. Brush up on linear algebra and statistics by working through a couple of textbooks \(Intro to linear algebra, Intro to math statistics and applied predictive modeling\)
2. Learn Python and SQL and some of the data science toolkits using [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net) and the new Python for Data Analysis textbook. I might start switching over to Python for doing some of my data analysis for my project, depending on how easy/hard it is to get going to familiarize myself with it.
3. Take a couple of machinelearning and data science courses on edx and coursera 
4. My wife is a Veterinarian with a really strong interest in public health so I think I'm going to come up with a project in this field with her help. It seems like it would be relatively high impact, interesting and if I succeed, impressive to interviewers 

Does anyone have any advice on other things I can do?

I work for a company that sends team members to customers' houses and like all the Grubhubs and Comcasts of the world, we'd like to be able to intelligently and accurately provide our customers with as small an estimated arrival window as possible.   

&amp;nbsp;

Unlike the above mentioned companies, I think our situation has a few unique challenges.  

&amp;nbsp;

1) Customers frequently cancel/reschedule  
2) Customer visits are frequently shuffled around between team member's queues/routes as the day progresses  
3) The amount of time spent at each customer's house is highly variable and can depend on many factors  

&amp;nbsp;

With that in mind, our arrival-time prediction process has to account for:  

&amp;nbsp;

1) travel time between customers  
2) time spent onsite with each customer  
3) variability introduce by customers cancelling or the visit being rerouted to a different teams members' queue  

&amp;nbsp;

The first two are straight forward enough to predict on their own but I'm not sure how to account for variability within the overall process particularly since:  
 
&amp;nbsp;

  1) any delays are cumulative (i.e. if team member is onsite longer than expected early in the day, their arrival at later stops on their route will also be delayed)  
  2) arrival can be affected by the visit being moved to a different (shorter or longer) queue  

&amp;nbsp;

2. The distribution level: compare the mean distribution of RT to individual distributions using:
- chi-squared for goodness of fit
- Kullback–Leibler divergence test
- Kolmogorov–Smirnov test

3. Find a cool bayesian way to do it (which?)
4. Use a mixed-effect regression model, and calculate the marginal contribution of the people (R square test).

102,CunningVigilante,1526927622.0,8l34je,25,datascience,"I am wondering which programming language should I learn to stay ""fresh"". 

To be honest it's been a while since I actually ""sat down and learned"" a new language (and I actually like the process). For obvious reasons I am looking for something new (not exactly eager to learn VBA for example) with big potential to be used in data science / machine learning / big data as these are the areas with which I am strongly connected both professionally and academically.

&amp;nbsp;

I know Python and R are the most popular.

I know SQL is VERY useful to know.

I know JavaScript and software such as Tableau are used to ""fancy up"" your visualizations before showing them to upper management. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

But what's new? I am looking at GitHub / Stack Overflow popularity charts, seeing languages like Rust, Julia or Clojure and I have no clue whether it is worth learning any of those languages, and if so, which one? Even when it comes to Scala (although not THAT new and widely used in Hadoop Ecosystem) I am not sure if it is worth a fuss.

&amp;nbsp;

Before someone comes and tells me that it is always good to learn new programming language - I guess I agree, it makes you a better programmer in general. But the problem with learning new things is that it takes time. I don't have much spare time in my life right now and definitely not for learning things that I will not find useful later on - in other words I don't have time for learning new programming languages just for the sake of it. That's why I am asking you for advice - to help me cherry pick the option that will be the most suitable for me.

* **Potential Upside In Dollars**: At first, usually a napkin CBA. I like to rank projects by this, and then start demoting them due to issues below. Sometimes this can be really tough for things that only improve internal processes. but I have found that when speaking to high level management, being able to attach even uncertain $ figures to stuff really, really helps. Even if it's as simple as getting max/min figures, like ""let's say we created an AI that replaced this entire department...this would only save us $300K a year"", or ""only 1% lift in this area, probably achievable by simple linear regression, would increase sales by $1M"".  
* **Level of Effort (To Our Team)**: Self explanatory. Worth considering if the project requires expertise that your team doesn't have, or will have to build as you go. 
* **Level of Effort (To IT/Other Teams)**: Does this project require deep cooperation from another business unit? Getting IT buy-in is a notorious struggle sometimes. 
* **Data Required**: Project killer. If the data isn't available or hasn't been collected appropriately, it might not get off the ground. 
* **Stakeholder Buy In**: Does whoever is in charge of the business unit that will be using your product actually want it? Even a really good idea with obvious upside can fail to succeed if a key individual in leadership resents being told what to do and drags their feet at every opportunity. 
* **Cool Factor**: Obviously more of a secondary concern, a good project would hopefully never be scrapped because it's boring.

I've been trying to follow this tutorial https://cambridgespark.com/content/tutorials/implementing-your-own-recommender-systems-in-Python/index.html which uses movies and a very similar system, except the users actually rated the movies.


Heres where I differed. I do not have a rating, so I built a range of scores from 1-5 using 

    temp['rating'] = temp.groupby(['steamid']) 
       ['playtime_forever'].transform(lambda x: pd.qcut(x.rank(method='first'), 5, 
        labels=range(1,6), duplicates='drop'))


This splits each users games into the quantile they played the most. For example, if I played 10 games, 2 for 10 hours, 2 for 8 hours... 2 for 1 hour, I would have scores 5,5,4,4...1,1.  For my matrix, I only included the most popular 3000 games, and I kicked out any game the user never played.  (So the recommender would potentially recommend 'play the damn game you bought!')


My problem, as far as I can tell, is that my similarity matrix is over saturated with 0s and so **my recommendations tend to be the same for each user.**  An example of my item scores for 1 user looks like '0.00292245, 0.0029871 , 0.00305141, ..., 0.00292783, 0.00293196', which are basically the same number.



This is the code I'm now struggling with that is giving me those results (taken from the link)

    from sklearn import cross_validation as cv
    train_data, test_data = cv.train_test_split(df4, test_size=0.25)

    train_data_matrix = np.zeros((n_users, n_items))
    for line in train_data.itertuples():
        train_data_matrix[line[1]-1, line[2]-1] = line[3]

    from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import pairwise_distances
    user_similarity = pairwise_distances(train_data_matrix, metric='cosine')
    item_similarity = pairwise_distances(train_data_matrix.T, metric='cosine')

    def predict(ratings, similarity, type='user'):
        if type == 'user':
            mean_user_rating = ratings.mean(axis=1)
            #You use np.newaxis so that mean_user_rating has same format as ratings
            ratings_diff = (ratings - mean_user_rating[:, np.newaxis])
            pred = mean_user_rating[:, np.newaxis] + similarity.dot(ratings_diff) /         
     np.array([np.abs(similarity).sum(axis=1)]).T
        elif type == 'item':
            pred = ratings.dot(similarity) / np.array([np.abs(similarity).sum(axis=1)])
        return pred

    item_prediction = predict(train_data_matrix, item_similarity, type='item')
    user_prediction = predict(train_data_matrix, user_similarity, type='user')


PS
All users must have at least 5 games to be considered (so they should have a game scored as 1-5)



Thank you!

So now we have a large data set array of about 30k animaton assets containing info like: how many times they've played, file sizes, animation categories, etc.

So what I was wondering is if there is any general advice one could impart on useful ways to sift through the data to find inefficiencies, how to handle outliers (ie: looped idle animations could play hundreds of times in a row) and any advice on good ways to communicate/visualize the stories that I uncover.

I've taken a few online courses and then data is all very clean or in easy formats. What is your workflow here? Some examples of your processes would be very useful

After you have created a satisfactory model \(let's just say in Python\), what are your next steps? If this model is meant for internal use, would you just leave it as a Python script? Would you add a GUI allowing end users to import data files \(i.e. CSVs\)? Maybe pickle? Would you use a framework like Flask to create a web app?

143,GrundleMoof,1526581421.0,8k6i2p,16,datascience,"Hi, I'm still doing the Kaggle [housing prices challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) and getting the hang of it. I did as much as I could and now I'm following some successful kernels more closely.

One thing I noticed done in [the current kernel I'm following](https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard) is, before he does One Hot Encoding on some categorical features, he does a step of Label Encoding on other categorical features. That is, he maps one value to 0, the next to 1, and so on. The features he chooses to do this to are mostly ones that probably \*do\* have some ordinal ordering. For example, with ""KitchenQual"" \(kitchen quality\), the values ""Typical/Average"", ""Fair"", ""Good"", ""Excellent"" probably are ordered in their effect on the label, so it's not that weird to assign them values 0\-3.

However, I noticed something strange in the code the guy uses to Label Encode them. He uses scikit learn's LabelEncode like so:

    for c in feats:
        lbl = LabelEncoder()
        lbl.fit(list(unskewed_df[c].values))
        print(""\n"",c,"": "")
        print(pd.unique(unskewed_df[c].values))
        print(lbl.transform(pd.unique(unskewed_df[c].values)))
        unskewed_df[c] = lbl.transform(list(unskewed_df[c].values))

the thing is, I'm pretty sure [LabelEncoder just does the mapping from labels to integers in a naive sorted order](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38749305/labelencoder-order-of-fit-for-a-pandas-df). As you can see in the link, that will often mean alphabetical order. I can see this from the print statements in the above code:

https://i.redd.it/5b1ad7mcigy01.png

where it's obviously in alphabetical order, not Po\-Fa\-Gd\-Ex or something. That feels wrong, because it's actually disrupting order/patterns where there actually are some.

Running this using my L1 linear regression model on this gives me these scores:

https://i.redd.it/52simvsqigy01.png

So, thinking that if they were actually in the right order, I added my own code, which first sorts the labels by their mean value, and then label encodes in that order. Here it is, sorry it's a little messy:

    label = ""SalePrice""
    for c in feats:
        catVar_df = copy(unskewed_df[[c]])
        catVar_df[label] = pd.Series(y_train_log)
        orderedMean = catVar_df.groupby(c).mean().sort_values(by=label)
        catOrder = orderedMean.iloc[:,0].index.tolist()
        
        catMap = dict(zip(catOrder,list(range(len(catOrder)))))
        print(""\n"",c,"": "")
        print(catOrder)
        print([catMap[val] for val in catOrder])
        unskewed_df[c] = unskewed_df[c].map(catMap)

Which gives a more reasonable mapping:

https://i.redd.it/is1fnp25jgy01.png

but, when I run it on the same exact model, a worse score!

https://i.redd.it/picyyfy6jgy01.png

This is really confusing to me because it feels like it should only be an improvement. As another piece of info, here are the same categorical feats that get mapped via his method \(""unordered""\):

https://i.redd.it/0vb30g2gkgy01.png

https://i.redd.it/n9g20h2gkgy01.png

Most entities were only seen on 1 day but some were seen on 3-4 and  even 5 days.  The entries in the matrix are binary for whether the entity was collected on that day.

I'm aware in the basic set up of a HMM, you can calculate the log likelihood by summing the final recursions of the forward algorithm over all the hidden states.

Does anyone have any idea if this result stays the same when you introduce a new set of latent variables that allow you to model the emission distribution as a mixture. In the graphical model, the mixture components have arrows coming from the hidden state, and going to X.

The model I'm thinking of can be found in this paper \(figure 4\) [https://www.cs.ubc.ca/\~carenini/PAPERS/ijcai11CR\-Joty.pdf](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini/PAPERS/ijcai11CR-Joty.pdf)

I feel like these new latent variables don't affect the forward &amp; backward computations of alpha and beta at all. And in this case, I think the log likelihood can be calculated in the same way as without the mixture components. Is this correct?

These data files are replete with lookup formulas and such to maintain a record of what was sent, when, and if it is flagged for Do-Not-Contact.

* Maintain multiple 200k+ record databases of names, addresses, and a few other bits of information
* Able to suppress or de-dupe records between databases, or using a separate ""Do Not Contact"" spreadsheet and flag existing data as undeliverable
* Pull the data using simple filters like date ranges or currency ranges, and to make note of what campaign this data was used for (for future reference and so we don't resend campaigns too quickly)

Ideally, I would love to just go to whatever this hypothetical thing would be that maintains this data, and then filter by a few categories, and be confident that the data is also clean based on a few other lists to suppress against. 

Bonus credit: An entirely separate project, we are in the beginning stages of looking into housing this data on a cloud server like Azure or AWS, simply because at a certain level, credit bureau data is required to be in a secure environment, which means firewalls/penetration testing/security patches and we are thinking much of that would be addressed by going offsite with the server.

One task I regularly complete as a data analyst is to review performance metrics and the first question I have when I see something change is why? 

Although there can be a lot of fundamental reasoning behind a shift in performance (e.g a strategy change) sometimes it can simply be due to a shift within a specific feature (e.g a specific country decides to convert 100%). 

Is there any mathematical method that I can run my outcome data through (split by features in question) to find if a shift in any of the segments has caused the trend? 

I would only be interested in a change for a segment if it was significant in driving the trend (e.g the country that provides 1% of business changing from 50% to 100% conversion is irrelevant as it will not cause a significant shift in overall performance).

Appreciate PSI could be used for this but I am more concerned around a stable population and understanding if a shift for a specific segment has caused the overall trend.

Appreciate this is a bit of a wall of text and may not be in the right place but it's been bugging me and I'm struggling to know what to Google?

Firstly is this approach correct? 

If so how do I determine the relative strength of the feature I've removed? In the equation for the line the regression model outputs, I believe the coefficient of each feature is it's relative importance to the target/ dependant variable, but if one of my features doesn't appear in the equation because it isn't independent of other features, does that not mean I have no info on the effects of the removed feature on my target and the effects of all the other features in it's category would be skewed up?

I currently work at a software services company, and struggle somewhat with experimentation concepts.

I've often been told my experiments are just ""throwing changes into the wind to see what will happen"", or that I'm ""not focusing on the right groups"" or that my experiment is designed around ""unsubstantiated hypotheses"", etc etc.

* Good approach to making hypotheses and designing experiments
* Guidelines for logging exposures so that the data is valid and imbalanced exposures don't happen

A ""hackathon"" is an attempt to ideate and make progress toward solutions to shared challenges. Hack for the Sea is slightly different than many other hackathons in that:

* It focuses on marine science exclusively
* All submissions must be released as open source
* It is meant to be a healthy, inclusive, and outcome-driven event.

This year's challenges come from our beneficiary organizations: the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI), the Gloucester Marine Genomics Institute (GMGI), The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, Ocean Alliance, and the MassBays National Estuary Program.

1. How does a changing coastal watershed impact coastal waters?
2. Where and when will Cod spawning occur?
3. Can a whale be identified based on their blowholes?
4. Can a mooring be designed that is not only eelgrass-friendly, but also user-friendly?

198,Wozezeka,1526185921.0,8j1l42,5,datascience,"I'm approaching my annual review after my first year in this position (Research Analyst, but I work exclusively w data, I don't really do lit reviews or qualitative work). In that time I have taken initiative to improve many aspects of my programs including:


Automate ~ 20 reports that were previously completed using excel pivot tables. 


Established documentation for these reports, the data collection process, data cleaning, etc.


Corrected 2 years worth of incorrectly entered data


Consolidated up to 10 years of data for 6+ programs. Data was stored in monthly/quarterly/yearly files and, due to the ongoing nature of data collection, contained duplicate information across files. This consolidation has allowed my to identify errors in the data sets and improve reporting.


Established relationships with program directors to discuss data collection, reporting needs, and assist them by creating user-friendly data collection documents and using their input to adapt reports and/or create new variables


Started a data audit for 4 programs. After finding numerous errors, un-entered data, incorrectly entered data, inconsistent data entry protocols, etc, I decided to just look at the data from top to bottom. These programs had changed hands on numerous occasions and, without any documentation, each person handled things a little differently. This is still on going, but it's been helpful.


I've starting writing code for as much as I can. I held off for a while because my co-workers rarely code and I didn't want to set up an infrastructure that someone else couldn't follow. I got tired of doing things the hard way so I just started coding everything. It's been very helpful for ad hoc requests and other occasional reports.


I've also begun the process of transferring our data to a more secure platform. This is taking a bit of time due to the data audit and we are making some changes to another program, but things haven't been finalized yet.


Once I feel like I can trust the data and have transferred it into a more secure platform, I'll be able to do some research on the data. We have many years worth of data that has not yet been analyzed beyond descriptive statistics.


With my annual review coming up, I am really hoping to be up for a promotion to senior research analyst. I feel like the work I've done is above and beyond and is setting us up to do more interesting work. All of this work will also facilitate data requests (we tend to get lots of last minute data requests from the higher ups)


When I started, we had 3 Senior Analysts, one was promoted and 2 left. A lot of the programs I work on were previously overseen by a sr analyst. So I don't think it would be... odd to add a Sr analyst to the team seeing as we don't have any right now. 


I've certainly made mistakes, typically typo's or forgetting to update values, data cleaning etc. However I've always made sure that I don't repeat the same mistake twice and I'm trying to move everything into R scripts to make things a bit easier and fool proof.


So my question is, is it reasonable to think that this level of work is worth a promotion? And if so, how would you recommend approaching this issue? (I have the description of a Research Analyst position, but I don't have a job description for a Sr. Analyst position)

211,BisonPuncher,1526081973.0,8is8f7,2,datascience,"***TLDR:** Business with hundreds of products needs detailed analytics on each product, but having hundreds of spreadsheets to update isnt viable anymore because its inefficient and time consuming. Not sure what would be the best way to go about solving this problem through either excel or other means*

I have no professional background in data science or programming, these are just things I've had to learn the 101 in to aid in what I do.

My company sells product on Amazon, and commercially available tools for forecasting orders, inventory, sales, refunds, etc are a bit too basic and do not deliver what I need.

Currently I have a bunch of excel sheets which do the job perfectly fine, but its getting to be too time consuming keeping them updated with the latest data. I have to download sales reports, add the latest data into my sheets, hit refresh, and then all is well. The problem is that I have so many sheets that cant be consolidated into one, that inputting the data takes hours every week. Another downside is the data is out of date as soon as I process it because it isnt real-time. Amazons API also offers data that I cannot get through downloading reports, so I would like to start receiving my data automatically through API calls for more advanced forecasting.

My end goal is to call the needed information through Amazons API, and then have some system which automatically parses and manipulates that information to my predefined specifications, and then displays a visualization and a few forecasts. I have hundreds of SKUs and would want an overall visualization of the entire business, and an individual for each SKU. This is where it gets difficult for me.

It sounds like I just defined Power BI, but I cant import API data with Power BI. I also would need to still run all of this through my hundreds of spreadsheets. I have an individual spreadsheet for each product we sell as I like to keep detailed analytics on each one, and compiling them all into a single workbook would be CPU suicide. I cannot think of a single way to keep doing this with Excel.

For that, I brought together a group of friends (4 including myself) that know only basic python. I would appreciate any type of help to decide what each of us is going to study. I have about 5 hours of free time everyday to use for that and am taking the Stanford ML course at coursera, my friends will have much less time than that but are very intellectually talented.

P.S. Our goal is to have a presentable project by the end of the hackathon, we don't expect to come up with anything fancy or win the competition.

229,Skys__,1525986020.0,8ii8js,2,datascience,"Hey,

I work at a start-up and have a question if anyone does growth experiments. Basically, our CEO believes that most experiments should be tested against conversion(paying us money). 

Since we have a large top of funnel but small conversion rate, experiments ran directly against that end up taking a very long time for significant results. I also think that loses some significant results because not all inputs are individually significant but as a whole, they create actual conversion growth. 

I am of the opinion that while our goal should still be higher conversions, we should be testing against whatever the behaviour is of that actual test. For example, if we're experimenting on raising usage of a certain feature, we should test against usage of that feature(while also looking to make sure we're not doing a trade-off somewhere else).

247,ChrisLloyd58,1525933742.0,8ictfm,3,datascience,"For some predictive analytics tasks, a sensible measure of model success is lift. This is the mean of Y is conditional on the fitted value being higher than a percentile of its distribution. For instance, in classification the proportion of responders conditional on the estimated probability being in the top decile is often used.
 
My problem is that this measure can be very unstable when choosing between models. An extreme case is when comparing k-nearest neighbour models where the fitted probabilities are all multiples of 1/k and so there are lots ties. But there is also some instability for models with more continuous fitted probabilities, just because of how the responses happen to fall to one side or the other of the decile boundary.

Several obvious approaches suggest themselves. My question is whether there is a standard way to measure lift that will smooth out these kinds of irregularities so that it can be better used as a model selection criterion.

For my dissertation I am comparing the different measurements of income inequality. All these measurements, measure income inequality in a different way, using different components of income (e.g. disposable income, real income). The aim is to find the “best/ most suitable” measurement for income inequality. To compare these different measurements, I want to use a synthetic/artificial dataset, to overcome any biased results. 
This dataset I want to construct, needs to have the “real” information about the income inequality in this dataset. In that way, I can compare the other measurements (e.g. gini-coefficient, theil-index, quantilies, Atkinson measurement) to the “real” outcome (income inequality) in the dataset. The number that comes closest to the outcome of the dataset should be the “best/most suitable” measurement for income inequality.
With the idea of the more data, the better, I was thinking of constructing a dataset with information about a 1,000 households. With the artificial/synthetic information about the income of these households, I can use certain tax tariffs, price levels and inflation to create the other datapoints, which are used to measure income inequality. Lastly, for some of the income inequality measurements, a time-period is needed, to see the change over years. Thus, this dataset needs to be constructed as a time-series. 

As a beginner in data science, this constructs the following problems/questions for me;
** How to create this synthetic dataset? (Fourier transform from a real income dataset?)
** How to valid this synthetic dataset?
** How to get the “real” income inequality out of the dataset, so I can compare this to the other outcomes of income inequality measurements?

The data is just sitting there, at the moment, with no immediate research question underway (I'm sure that'll change in the near future though).

What do I have exactly?

* App-events: which app was used, which category (social, communication, etc.), at which location and point in time, for how long, part of which session (see below), and whether you followed a notification to start the app (e.g. WhatsApp notification was tapped to start convo)
* Sessions: starts when you pick up and unlock your phone, ends when it gets locked
* Notifications: what notification, from which app, at which time.

My question to you guys: what type of questions would be the most interesting to answer with this type of data? I'm currently looking into association rule mining, and simple stuff like 

* How many sessions are the result of a notification being tapped, compared to the overall use?
* How long do these sessions last (do people get stuck in smartphone use because notifications draw them in)?

I'm working with a data set on credit card recovery liquidation.

According to exploratory plots, females liquidate 10% more often as a group than males, and liquidate 3.5% greater in terms of average overall payback.

I've regressed the total liquidation percentage on gender and it comes back as significant. However, I can't put the majority of other explanatory variables into the model as they come from a differently derived data set at the moment.

Is this enough to infer that there is a difference in $ liquidated between genders? My standard deviation for liquidation - over the ENTIRE data set of 33,000 is 0.20 (20%) so it's very large.

However the linear model suggests a distinct difference. What can I conclude from this and what extra analysis may need to take place? Do I need more data?


edit: I should mention that the P value on my linear model is e-11, so highly significant but my residual standard error is a giant 27% on a data set where the mean is 20%.

One of my experience when soliciting opinions of my pics from friends had an inherent bias in itself. Quite often, my female friends would have a favourable opinion compared to male ones. This led me to investigate if there is an inherent bias in the way a person responds to same gender pictures.

To check and validate for this hypothesis, I used a picture of mine and got it rated from [Photofeeler!](https://www.photofeeler.com) for ratings from the community. The intent was to understand and capture if the hypothesis can be statistically validated.

[Photofeeler!](https://www.photofeeler.com) is a means to get community votes to rate one’s pictures. You could either use earned karma to get votes or buy credits to exchange for votes.

* Alternate Hypothesis : The opposite gender will rate the picture’s attractive levels higher.

* Male group sample size : 23
* Female group sample size : 20
* Parameter under investigation : Attractive

But if they gave a response such as 1 (which is for Christianity) in the DG3A column then the value in the next column would be empty. How would I cater for these missing values (which aren't really missing instead needed not to be filled)?

I, as our 'data guy' along with our DBA are all for that, and we've arrived at the conclusion that for all the things senior staff wants us to do, we need to have good data governance in place as a foundation to allow us to do the type of things they want us to do.

'Data governance' can mean a lot of different things, depending on who you're asking.  For us, There are a few primary areas that we are focusing on under the aegis of 'Data Governance':  For us, we are talking about policies and practices regarding 1) How data is ingested into our databases 2) How various data types are formatted (IE locations as geocoded lat/long instead of address strings) 3) How and where data is stored 4) Who has access to what data at what point in time.

I'm hoping that the good people of this sub can help me get pointed in the right direction, as well as pitfalls to avoid.  I don't have experience creating data governance policies, so I unfortunately am struggling with even knowing the right questions to ask!  My org is also in a position where our data is *highly* sensitive and data security is of primary concern (we've had foreign governments try to access our data, and if the wrong data gets out it could completely topple the org.  However, that data is also essential for the work almost everyone here does).  I don't know if that factors into what data governance model we want to go with, but it is something that we have to keep in mind so I thought I'd mention it.  So I guess at this point, does anyone have any experiences in this arena that they would be willing to share with the class?  Does anyone have any resources that they've used (books, websites, things of that sort) to establish data governance in their organization?

If change to Maths I have the chance to start at their 2nd year which makes it 4 years to get my BS degree at ETH,yet If I change to Maths it's going to be a whopping 5 year-study at ETH untill I finally got my BS degree since I could only start at first year again...I don't know the academic reputation and recognition of ETH and these two particular fields among top CS institutions in the US(e.g. CMU,MIT and Stanford...I'm not sure if ETH and these schools are at the same level tho...) or in other english-speaking countries(e.g. UK,CAN) looks like?

Plus which one could be a smoother transition academic-wise: I've taken one semester of C++, Analysis 1+2+3, Lin Al 1+2, Physics 1+2.

286,GrundleMoof,1525750423.0,8htola,8,datascience,"Hey guys, I have a couple questions about handling categorical features, as I'm learning and trying these kaggle challenges. I'll use the kaggle housing prices challenge as an example because I'm doing that now. 

Often, some categorical \(but not ordinal\) feature will have, say, 5 different values, and if you plot the values of that feature vs the label \(SalePrice\), you can notice a difference between values that would probably give you some information when trying to predict the SalePrice. Here's an example:

https://i.redd.it/gr2vgxj0tjw01.png

I've ordered them in order of ascending mean SalePrice. So you can see that there might be some information from this feature.

So it seems like a common strategy at this point is to do one hot encoding \(OHE\), so that the feature becomes 5 separate binary features, and instead of having the value, say, ""RM"" for the feature, the new RM feature has the value 1 and the other new features \(C, RH, RL, FV\) have the value 0. This strategy seems like it would work for either linear regression or something like random forest regression \(RFR\) \(the two models I'm messing around with\), right?

I actually have a couple questions about this strategy. First, let's say the mean of two of the feature values \(in this case, RM and RH\) are really similar. Is there any reason to, or not to, combine them before OHE? It seems like it would save a feature, and simplicity is usually better.

My other question is, let's just assume we were only using RFR \(not lin reg\). If I understand decision trees usually, for a non\-ordinal categorical feature, the DT for only that feature must do some sort of binary type search, like asking {C, RM, RH} or {RL, FV}, and then splitting it further from there \(is this correct?\). But let's say that the categorical feature did actually have a monotonic ordering to it \(like above\). Then could it be worth converting it to a numerical feature, because that would allow the DT/RFR to do the same thing it does for numerical features?

Lastly, and this may be really dumb, I was thinking about how to convert a feature \(that's categorical, non ordinal, but does have some ordering it if you sort it\) like above to be used with linear regression, without doing OHE.  For simplicity, let's say you have a feature like this with the 4 values A,B,C,D:

https://i.redd.it/7qvrxl84xjw01.png

They're obviously increasing. If we just instead replace them with the values 1,2,8,9, then we get the plot:

https://i.redd.it/pzsy8t69xjw01.png

And now we have one linear feature that takes care of all the values, rather than as many features as the original feature had unique values. A common reason I hear that you can't do this is that the different feature values don't actually have any relation to each other \(on the x axis\) \-\- but I don't think this matters: as long as your test set doesn't have new values for the feature, I think it should work.

Is there some reason this wouldn't work? thanks!Question about engineering categorical features?",hey guys couple questions handling categorical features learning trying kaggle challenges use kaggle housing prices challenge example often categorical ordinal feature say different values plot values feature vs label saleprice notice difference values would probably give information trying predict saleprice example https redd gr vgxj tjw png ordered order ascending mean saleprice see might information feature seems like common strategy point one hot encoding ohe feature becomes separate binary features instead value say rm feature new rm feature value new features c rh rl fv value strategy seems like would work either linear regression something like random forest regression rfr two models messing around right actually couple questions strategy first let say mean two feature values case rm rh really similar reason combine ohe seems like would save feature simplicity usually better question let assume using rfr lin reg understand decision trees usually non ordinal categorical feature dt feature must sort binary type search like asking c rm rh rl fv splitting correct let say categorical feature actually monotonic ordering like could worth converting numerical feature would allow dt rfr thing numerical features lastly may really dumb thinking convert feature categorical non ordinal ordering sort like used linear regression without ohe simplicity let say feature like values b c https redd qvrxl xjw png obviously increasing instead replace values get plot https redd pzsy xjw png one linear feature takes care values rather many features original feature unique values common reason hear different feature values actually relation x axis think matters long test set new values feature think work reason work thanks question engineering categorical features

I have a couple of iMacs with 24/32 GB of RAM, but I often have to work around that by working with data in batches. I am also chewing through more and more storage. I am generally using Python/pandas with growing use of databases and ML. Most of my use with lots of data is prepping, exploring, and summarizing. For my actual regression models with aggregated data, they run easily on a desktop, so they're not driving my thinking here.

I've been looking at a few options:

1. Build a Linux desktop with more RAM and storage (and possibly a solid GPU) and connect to it locally/remotely using Jupyter. The downsides are cost,having to keep it running and updated, and having robust and secure remote access.
2. Use a cloud service. I like what I'm seeing from Azure Notebooks, but it's going to be some time before this is developed into a solid option (in part because of hardware instance limitations while it's a beta).
3. Buy an iMac Pro or wait out a Mac Pro update. Downsides here are cost and the lack of an nvidia GPU option.
4. Keep working around limitations. Essentially, this is assuming that the cost or overhead of the options won't offset the marginal efficiency from having more hardware.

Eventually, I think a cloud service will be the best option. However, it doesn't seem like we're there yet, and I think that it may be long enough that I should bridge the gap with more hardware. The difference with being an academic is that I'm largely responsible for the whole chain of making my stuff work (other than special cases like using the university's cluster), so I want things that just work to the extent possible.

**THE CONCEPT**

I wanted to look at a couple different ways to portray release date and see how they affected the success of the movie. To do this, I first had to define a measurement of movie success. Seeing as it is the producing company who decides the release date of a movie, I decided to use the most important metric to them: $$$. However, it didn't make sense to use simply the revenue gained by the movie, because raw revenue numbers have an innate bias towards bigger movies with bigger budgets. For example, a movie with a production budget of $200 million that grosses $700 million would be considered extremely successful. However, so would a movie with a production budget of $20 million that grosses $70 million. Raw revenue number would show the second movie as being equally successful as a movie with a production budget of $200 million the grosses $250 million, which makes no sense. As such, I decided that my metric for success should be total revenue divided by production budget, thus scaling all of the movies to an equal scale.

The three portrayals of release date that I chose were week of the year, month of the year, and day of the week. 

**THE DATA**

At first, I used data scraped from [boxofficemojo.com](http://www.boxofficemojo.com), but then I realized that it only included data for movies that had grossed over $200 million. Seeing as that excludes a lot of the less successful movies (an important exclusion, since one of my variables is supposed to measure success), I had to switch. I ended up using data from the [TMDB 5,000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data), which is data in csv format regarding 5,000 movies. It included all of the values I needed, which were title, revenue, budget, and release date.

**THE DATA WRANGLING**

First, I calculated the necessary values. Revenue weighted by budget was easy enough, and I called it percent return. With my original data this name made a lot more sense. However, only as I typed this up did I realize that it is nonsensical. I'm too lazy to go back and fix it, so it will stay that way.

R deals with dates really well, so in order to display them on a graph, all I had to do was make a new column equal to the release date minus January 1 of the release year. I called this column, logically, days_since_jan_1.

To get week of the year, I subset the rows with day values in the correct range and set the correct week number. I applied this to all 52 weeks using a for loop. The 365th and 366th day (leap years) were thrown in with the 52nd week.

Month of the year was easy, I just pulled a substring out of the date value.

For day of the week, I converted the release date to a POSIXlt object and used $wday to record the numerical day of the week. Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc.

**THE DISPLAY**

Now that I had the necessary values, I displayed them in a variety of formats. First, I created data frames of weekly, monthly, and daily medians and displayed them in scatterplots. These were the results: [Weekly](https://imgur.com/vrLmT1g), [monthly](https://imgur.com/2A3xIFT), and [daily](https://imgur.com/jOOiB0b). Remember, the days of the week are 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, etc.

However, since these graphs are automatically scaled, any small difference can look significant. For some context, I graphed them as box plots, too. [Weekly](https://imgur.com/3nRXjlQ), [monthly](https://imgur.com/LvAw6nD), and [daily](https://imgur.com/uv6J9Lw).

**STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE**

There's no real way to know if all of this work means anything until statistical significance tests are applied. I chose to use a one-factor T Test to compare the mean of each week/month/day to the population mean.

*Monthly Results*

I'm going to start broad and work my way in. With an alpha of 0.05, the months with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* January (lower)
* March (lower)
* September (lower)
* October (lower)
* June (higher)
* November (higher)

When the alpha was lowered to 0.01, the months with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* September (lower)
* June (higher)

*Conclusion:* Movies are most profitable when released in the early summer and towards the end of the year, and least profitable when released at the beginning of the year and at the beginning of the school year.

*Weekly Results*

With an alpha of 0.05, the weeks with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* January 1-7 (lower)
* February 19-25 (lower)
* March 25-31 (lower)
* April 1-7 (lower)
* August 19-25 (lower)
* August 26-September 1 (lower)
* September 9-15 (lower)
* October 7-13 (lower)
* May 20-26 (higher)
* June 17-23 (higher)
* June 24-30 (higher)
* November 4-10 (higher)
* November 11-17 (higher)
* December 9-15 (higher)

When the alpha was lowered to 0.01, the weeks with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* August 19-25 (lower)
* August 26-September 1 (lower)
* September 9-15 (lower)
* June 24-30 (higher)
* December 9-15 (higher)

*Conclusion:* Movies are most profitable when released between late May and late June and between November and early December and least profitable when released in early January, between mid February and early April, and between mid August and mid September.

*Daily Results*

With an alpha of 0.05, the days of the week with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* Friday (lower)
* Saturday (lower)
* Wednesday (higher)
* Thursday (higher)

When the alpha was lowered to 0.01, the weeks with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* Friday (lower)
* Saturday (lower)
* Wednesday (higher)

*Conclusion:* Movies are most profitable when released on Wednesdays and least profitable when released on Fridays and Saturdays.

What’s really interesting was that the analyst was able to extract the individual strong classifiers out of the random forest and make individual insights using the predictors. I’ve not written such a model from scratch but using statistical packages (e.g. Scikit-Learn) the classifier doesn’t output insights such as these showing how the various predictors interact. Does anyone know how that can be done?

But in those 5 years we have seen ML go from running Log Regressions and pasting results in a powerpoint, to Deep Learning becoming finally computationally feasible, GPUs and more GPUs, the advent of AWS, advancements in Reinforcement Learning, NLP, AI and Computer Vision that are going to push the boundaries even more in ML with old school supervised learning becoming less and less important giving way to a more hybrid form of AI, and ML becoming a core software engineering product at many of the best tech companies with many amazing novel case studies.

ML has firmly moved towards engineering in the tech industry regardless of what the statisticians like to think here. Many companies have already adopted to this realization by renaming their roles to be ""Machine Learning Engineer"" or ""Research Scientist"" or ""Applied Scientist"" often with PhD requirements. I now view data science as data extraction, analysis and statistical experimentation. There is simply no value to do ML work if you lack software engineering skills today.

314,malacusquai,1525538994.0,8h8qgm,6,datascience,"I have a very specific problem I am trying to tackle and I was wondering if anyone here had any ideas or papers they can point me to.  We run tests which generate tons of log files.  The number and type of log files varies with the type of test.  We take the failures and put them into sightings that get assigned to engineers for debug. 

I want to create a machine learning system that analyzes the generated log files and automatically groups The failures based on the similarities in the log files.  There is a lot of information about how to cluster log files with the ""bag of words"" approach but my scenario has some interesting challenges that I am trying to work through.

1. The are multiple log files per failure.  I need to group the failures not the files specifically.
2. There are thousands of words in each log file but likely there will only be 10-20 that are important in classifying/grouping the failure.
3. I want the system to learn from the past so if an engineer regroups the failures it will use this information in the future.
4. Often there will only be groups of 1 so a new set of failures could have many groups of similar failures or few groups.

I have tried the following supervised approach which was unsuccessful.
1. Get past failures with their sightings as a training set
2. Extract word frequencies for each log file. 
3. For each log file, find the cosine distance from every failures bag of word to every other failure.  There are n(n-1)/2 records now.
4. Find the outputs which is 1 if the two records have the same sighting and 0 otherwise.
5.  The output of these steps is nxm matrix where the rows are the  failure pairs and the columns are the log files. Each element is the cosine distance for that pair and log file.
6.  I feed the nxm and the outputs into a learning model. (I tried naive Bayes, knn, random forest)
7. For new failures I generate the same matrix and determine the output.

What's the problem? The system almost always guesses 0 for the pairs.  I think the issue is that the 1s (pairs in the same sighting) are sparse so the model just normally guesses 0 and is right 95 percent of the time. Also logs that are different tent to have high cosine distance even when they are different because so many of the irrelevant words are the same.

I was thinking semi unsupervised approach may be better here.

Now I want to also use the categorical features. I discovered quickly that the RFR tries to turn all features into floats \(I tried to just do it naively, assuming it would take a categorical variable and use that\), so I have to turn them into floats.

Let's say I have a categorical feature with 3 values, A, B, C. Let's say the different feature values \*do\* have different average labels \(for the housing challenge, ""SalePrice""\). The most naive thing I can think of to do is doing One Hot Encoding on this feature. But do I even need to do that, if my model is a random forest? 

I know why I'd have to if I were doing Linear Regression or something, but here the model is just making yes/no decisions anyway, right? That is, it will just do something like ""A, yes/no?"", and then lower in the tree, ""B, yes/no?"", etc, right?

That being said, your response will not be my answer. Ive done all the heavy lifting but just don't know which algorithms are a 'best fit' for my scenario.

I've built naive Bayes, svm, knn, and k-means and have precision and recall scores for each, but I don't know which of the models is best suited for accuracy (the criteria for the tweets are two specific hashtags). A high precision score may not indicate that it's the best fit, as a poor model could be coincidentally generating a high score for this dataset but may not generally perform well for this type of problem (from my understanding). 

A lot of reading on the classifiers are, to be frank, way too dense for me to understand.

You can see that it would be a okay linear \(or maybe quadratic\) fit to the data, except when 2ndFlrSF = 0, it's kind of all over the place. This kind of makes sense: you'd expect the price to increase with the square footage of the 2nd floor, unless it doesn't have a second floor. In that case, you're looking at a distribution of SalesPrice values that depend on other stuff.

Now, I could do this by hand, but it'd get kind of messy, basically using linear regression on this feature IF it doesn't equal 0. Is there a neater way to do this? Another option I was thinking of was creating the feature 2ndFlrSF\*SalePrice, which would get rid of those ones at 0.

i guess my question is how developed can software get to where it knows if a user is being ironic, ""trolling"", or purposefully working opposite to the applications intended use. would profiles that deviate from 'honest' users just be discarded as compromised data, or fall into some form of outlier category? i find algorithmic software very interesting in this scenario, and am curious to see how algorithms account for disobedient or comically ironic user behavior.

We have an amazing tech stack and I get to use a lot of the latest tools and learn from some bright minds in the industry.

Because it is a start up with only 7 data scientists we handle all aspects of the data pipeline such as data ingestion and cleaning using airflow, data modeling, data warehouse in bigquery and front end dashboards using tableau. I have also deployed several models and put them into production using spark, scikitlearn wrapped around in a flask API with docker and kubernetes.

367,Karyo_Ten,1525082433.0,8fycaw,2,datascience,"Hey, I've been working for a bit more than a year on my own tensor library from scratch (first commit on April 13, 2017).

What started as a hobby and curiosity project to learn more about linear algebra, machine learning, deep learning and a young programming language called Nim became a huge evening time sink.

After implementing Numpy-like ndarrays, Torch/Tensorflow like primitives, I just finalised the first part of my high-level API which hopefully takes the best from Keras and PyTorch.

I’d like your feedback on that. Quick note on Nim, it is a strongly typed language, hence why you see f32/float32 from time to time.

For example, declaring a two-layers NN currently is like this:

    # ##################################################################
    # Environment variables
    
    # N is batch size; D_in is input dimension;
    # H is hidden dimension; D_out is output dimension.
    let (N, D_in, H, D_out) = (64, 1000, 100, 10)
    
    # Create the autograd context that will hold the computational graph
    let ctx = newContext Tensor[float32]
    
    # Create random Tensors to hold inputs and outputs, and wrap them in Variables.
    let
      x = ctx.variable(randomTensor[float32](N, D_in, 1'f32))
      y = randomTensor[float32](N, D_out, 1'f32)
    
    # ##################################################################
    # Define the model.
    
    network ctx, TwoLayersNet:
      layers:
        fc1: Linear(D_in, H)
        fc2: Linear(H, D_out)
      forward x:
        x.fc1.relu.fc2
    
    let
      model = ctx.init(TwoLayersNet)
      optim = model.optimizerSGD(learning_rate = 1e-4'f32)
    
    # ##################################################################
    # Training
    
    for t in 0 ..&lt; 500:
      let
        y_pred = model.forward(x)
        loss = mse_loss(y_pred, y)
    
      echo &amp;""Epoch {t}: loss {loss.value[0]}""
    
      loss.backprop()
      optim.update()

Spouse is 34 male with no known health issues other than high sperm DNA fragmentation and trigeminal neuralgia due to a botched wisdom tooth surgery. I and my identical twin sister have had health issues our whole lives but have no diagnosis despite lots of testing.

To attempt to overcome my husband and i’s recurrent miscarriage issues we recently attempted the first part of ivf with PGS screening of the embryos. We also took a screening test called Counsyl that looks for many common disorders, but it came back normal for both of us.

Dr called last week to say all 5 embryos sent for testing returned results of abnormal.

He suggested perhaps we have a translocation our previous standard resolution karyotype couldn’t find (older technology?).

4 of the 5 embryos had the same deletion on chromosome 12 in section 24.13. He forgot to mention the issue with embryo 5 as he decided he wanted to consult with the people at cooper geononics about the possibility of a missed translocation prior to discussing things further. He didn’t go into detail but seemed to imply there were multiple chromosome defects in addition to chromosome 12 on the each embryo.

He ordered a high resolution karyotype from quest and a FISH probe for chromosome 12 and 15 for my spouse and i. After my own simple uniformed google research i’m wondering if my spouse may have a mild case of noonans syndrome and if i have a mild case of marfans syndrome. Does this seem plausible? Is it feasible for us to create a viable embryo if we have these issues? All our embryos make it to 6.5 weeks with a standard heartbeat but then spontaneously pass away.

Do organisms just have different Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, specialized to create different aminoacyl-tRNAs? or do organisms have differences in their tRNA such that the same AARSs ends up causing a different code with them? Or do some organisms have other processes swap out the aminoacid for another after the creation of the aminoacyl-tRNA?

I'm just looking to get a big picture view of how the variation in genetic codes is realized, since I was taken by surprise by the fact that the genetic code is in a sense arbitrary and can vary across organisms.

408,gdtags,1526503817.0,8jye82,4,genetics,"30 year old caucasian (Italian descent) female with no significant medical history. I am currently 27 weeks pregnant. 5'3, 168 lbs. I live in the northeast United States. I take 2000 of vitamin D and a prenatal vitamin that contains folic acid and iron. I do not take any other medications.
Background: Throughout my pregnancy I have had a high heart rate (90s-100s) and palpitations. I have also had extreme exhaustion and fatigue (more so in the first trimester) and three near syncopal events (lightheaded, dizzy, nausea with or without vomiting, sweating and palpitations). I attributed these events to low blood pressure as I checked my BP after/during events and it was low (90/50). I have mentioned these symptoms to my OB and I have always gotten that its just normal pregnancy symptoms. I went to the ER the first time I experienced these symptoms and everything was normal (r/o PE, EKG normal, CT scan of chest normal, u/s of extremities normal). Ended up catching the flu but thats a different story.
So, after recent genetic testing and bloodwork, it appears I am a carrier for beta thalassemia and I have beta thalassemia minor. I have attached screen shots of my blood work (first two photos are from back in January, last photo is from this week's blood draw). I have not been officially diagnosed (I don't believe there is an official dx) but it has not even been recognized by my doctors. I have taken it upon myself to assume that that is what I have. There is also a mention of possible beta thalassemia minor in the Quest Diagnostic results. I also know my mother has it (minor). I know that this isn't a big deal but pregnancy can make you more symptomatic and it can commonly be misread as iron deficiency anemia. Side note: husband has been tested and he is not a carrier. Also, baby is good and everything (tests, ultrasounds, etc) have been normal.
I get a call today from a nurse at my OB office stating that my hemoglobin is low (10.3) and they want to start me on additional iron supplements. I have done my research and have a medical background myself and thought that iron supplements do not treat and can possibly do more damage for people with this thalassemia trait. Not to mention, iron makes me nauseous and constipated and I do not want to take it if its not going to help. I may be wrong but I mentioned this to the nurse. I told her I am a carrier for beta thalassemia. She said she would talk to the nurse practitioner and call me back. I get a call back saying that upon further review of my labs, my iron is normal and I should not take any more iron and just to ""keep doing what I'm doing"". Whatever that means?
My concern is, well...should I be concerned? My hemoglobin has dropped and is now considered low. I am also symptomatic (and have been throughout my pregnancy). Do I need to be worried about losing blood during delivery? Should I see a specialist? Should I be taking iron? I feel like I am not getting real answers from my doctors and that they aren't even recognizing this thalassemia trait. Or maybe I am overreacting. Any advice is appreciated!

I am currently doing a project using 2D geometric morphometric (GM) analysis, which leaves me with more data than observations. To be more specific, in GM you use landmark coordinates (could be X and Y, or X, Y, and Z if you are doing a 3D GM) that make up the shape you are interested in studying. In my project, I am trying to determine whether unknown specimens are taxonomically unique by comparing them to specimens from known species (in order to see whether the unknown specimens are not just within the known variation of the known specimens). For that I use the landmark coordinates. 

However, my sample size is very small, which is something that researches in my field had to deal with since its inception. We just don't find that many hominin fossils. Because my sample size is small, and the number of variables is large, I wonder whether it in some ways comparable to what geneticists do. For some reason I have this notion that geneticists work with hundreds if not thousands of genes, but with only a few specimens. 

My question is what are the most prevalent statistical tests in your field for testing phylogentic or taxonomic uniqueness/relationships. So far, it seems that for my project, the non-parametric MANOVA (or permutational MANOVA), or even hierarchical clusterting, seem to be just right.

Anyway, I was told that I’m not just a carrier of CF but that I inherited one copy of the 7T mutation from both of my parents so I actually have CF (but a really mild version I guess?) I was totally floored by the news as I am 35 and, to date, a pretty healthy person. They explained that this is quite anomalous since this variant is rare and of course, even rarer the likelihood that two carriers with it would meet and have children. Anyway, they explained this is very reassuring as it’s highly unlikely my baby will wind up having 7T like me and 7T also seems to be a very mild, even asymptomatic form of CF. They told me this may explain my issues with childhood asthma, chronic sinus infections, etc. On the other hand, I may just have allergies like a good portion of the population does anyway.  The counselor is going to refer my case to a CF specialist and ask if I need to come in for further follow up or testing but in her estimation this won’t be necessary. She thinks I’ve always been healthy, will continue to be healthy and have a normal lifespan.

Anyway, I’m a super anxious person and despite the reassurance, I’m a bit anxious that I can’t find more information about 7T and from what little I can find online, I read sort of mixed things about it. Does anyone here know more about these variants, specifically 7T? Obviously, I’m really happy I’m not a carrier of classic CF and that I don’t have it but I would still really appreciate more information about what I’m dealing with until I’m able to speak with an expert.

My paternal grandfather (my father's father) and my maternal grandmother (my mother's mother) are siblings. Also, my paternal grandmother (my father's mother) and my maternal grandfather (my mother's father) are siblings. My parents are therefore cousins.

I told my mother (from tribe B) that I'm very very certain that the faulty gene was introduced to tribe K by maternal grandfather's bloodline (tribe B). My reason for this is because I am certain that the mother of my maternal grandfather (who I just found out was from tribe K) wasn't a carrier of the gene. I am certain of this because she went on to marry another man, and had many children who had many children who have many children, and none have this condition.

my question is what is the probability that the faulty gene that I and my sister inherited, came from tribe B, via my maternal grandfather's father?

When browsing my 23andme raw data, I came across these:

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=rs28939075
* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=rs28937874

I was searching my raw genetic data for the LGI1 gene: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LGI1

A while back I was diagnosed with adult onset temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The symptoms of mine seem synonymous with a variant called ADPEAF (autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features), which are a bit different than the typical TLE that have the focus in the hippocampus. ADPEAF seems to have a focus more on the outer temporal lobe in the neocortex. Moreover, imaging proved that I have no hippocampal scarring (common in TLE), but instead a slight generalized atrophy. Basically, they couldn't find a focal point, but I do have focal epilepsy coming out of the left temporal lobe (based on EEG testing). There is no history of it in my family.

Anyway, this LGI1 gene has been implicated in ADPEAF and other types of epilepsies. It's also an autoimmune target.

I have 27 SNPs for this gene on chromosome 10, with 2 pathogenic alles (which I linked to above).

Anyway, based on this, is it possible that this is causing my epilepsy? If it is, would it ever be possible to fix this in the future with some type of drug?

Are pathogenic alleles normal? I noticed I have some for other genes. It is just bad luck if one happens to cause issues? Is this what is meant by the term epigenetics?

I am going to try to get an actual genetic test (if anyone actually does it for this... I don't think they test for it in a regular epilepsy gene panel), but I figured I'd ask this subreddit first because I'm interested in the topic.

Thank you all!

*edit* as it turns out, I was misinterpreting the UI/data. It is likely that I don't have a pathogenic allele, but I'm still going to try to get a more rigorous test done.

TLDR

I am interested in becoming a genetic engineer and working on projects involving gene therapy or modifying CRISPR/improving gene transfer methods. The classes I will be taking both here and abroad will be basic statistics, organic chemistry, and 3rd semester German, and they are all one semester long. The difference in schedule is the fourth class: cell biology \(also one semester long\).

If I stay at my university now, I will be taking intensive cell biology. This class is more challenging than the regular cell biology course. It covers genomics, subcellular organelles, cell signaling, and stem cells.

If I decide to go abroad, the intensive course is not offered and I will have to take regular cell biology, which covers the flow of genetic information, membranes and subcellular organelles, and cell regulation. In addition to this class, I will be taking an introduction to research class. In this research class, we will be looking at scientific literature, discussing project designs, listening to professors present their research, and designing a research project of our own and presenting results at the end of the semester.

I would love some advice on what to do. This is my only opportunity to go abroad \(summer is too expensive\) for my major. However, it is also the only time I can take the intensive cell bio course. Should I stay or go? What would be better for my career and plan of going on to graduate school?

PCA indicates that there is a high degree of stratification in terms of ancestry and non-random mating, but also that there is no directly applicable reference population panel that can be used for haplotype frequency estimation and phasing.

We have to be able to write essays on the genetic mutations associated with various diseases including both obvious monogenic genetic disorders (e.g. Haemophilia) and more complex (e.g. obesity). 

I'm struggling because I feel like my work at the moment is purely descriptive of the symptoms and clinical presentation without really going into the genetic mechanisms behind the diseases. But then when I study the genetic mechanisms I find them really confusing and so all I take away from papers are that they are caused my missense mutations/frameshifts/mRNA degradation/insertions/deletions/gross deletions/recombination with a pseudogene etc. However then it seems like they are all caused by the same types of mutation so it just seems shallow and insufficient to put that ""X disease can be caused by missense mutations/frameshifts/mRNA degradation/insertions/deletions/gross deletions/recombination with a pseduogene in gene Y""

Explain why carrier females are usually not affected by diabetes insipidus even though they carry a mutated copy of the gene.

The stem of the question says that the mutation is recessive. 

The answer talks about X-inactivation and how only about half of the cells that express the gene would have the mutation.

I would have thought that since it was recessive and that it was about carrier females, that it wouldn't even be necessary to go into X-inactivation because if someone was a carrier for an autosomal recessive condition they wouldn't have the disease because they have at least one copy of the functional gene.

I have a problem: I'm not a bioinformatician. Due to that problem I have a second problem. I have used an illumina short read kit to sequence some small fragments of different mitochondrial genes (CO1, CO2, ND2, ND5) for about 1000 individuals. The data came off our MiSeq and was sorted so that every individual has a file for each locus which contains all of the reads for only that locus. The fragments are all 127 bp and read depths range from a few hundred to a few thousand. I manually sorted through about 50 files using excel (I have ~4000 files in total; 4 loci x 1000 individuals) and noticed that there is some heteroplasmy and also a lot of sequencing/pcr error. For example, the CO1 file for individual #1 may contain 1000 reads, of those allele #1 will have a read depth of ~300, allele #2 will also have ~300, and the remaining ~400 reads are all singletons, garbage basically.
 
My question to you is: How can I best go about extracting the ""real"" haplotypes of the remaining ~3950 files? There must be a way to automate this in R or some other software. Basically I need to rank all of the reads based on copy number and then taking the top two...but I have no clue how.

---

This is probably something that's been discussed to death, but as happens frequently, the issue of ""who got there first"" came up in a political discussion in /r/southafrica and I've spent the last 2 days arguing about it.

I'm no geneticist; I've never even had any interest in the field so I'll be the first one to say that I have next to no idea what I'm talking about in this field.

Someone, in their argument mentioned the Out of Africa hypothesis as fact. I'd heard it was debunked so I went looking for info and found [this incredible -if fairly old - article](https://wakeup-world.com/2013/12/16/dna-evidence-debunks-the-out-of-africa-theory-of-human-evolution/) that debunks it.

The article suggests that current data disproves the idea that humanity originated in Africa because no haplotypes found have ever had a close to identical African match.

To sum up, the article basically says that the best guess is that humanity originated in Australia, but that its pretty certain from genetic evidence that humanity had no genesis in Africa.

So now, continuing to argue my point on /r/southafrica which is, frankly irrelevant to this discussion, I went to [The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-family-tree) where I found this page about the ""Human Family Tree"" which alleges that *Sahelanthropus tchadensis*, the oldest known ancestor to modern humans *lived sometime between 7 and 6 million years ago in West-Central Africa (Chad).*

That seems to contradict the information in the first article I linked.

- Is there any evidence the claim that ""this species lived here"" or is that claim made just because ""we found cranial material from this species here""?
- Does ""Out of Africa"" specifically refer to Homo sapien and ignore all earlier evolution of the human animal or is the Out of Africa assertion that humanity originated in Africa, period?

I'd like to qualify that last question:

[This article](https://wakeup-world.com/2013/12/16/dna-evidence-debunks-the-out-of-africa-theory-of-human-evolution/) which I linked above seems pretty iron clad to me in its analysis which arrives at the fact that the human race did not originate in Africa. I wonder then if the Out of Africa model makes a distinction of *Homo sapien* originating in Africa meaning Neandertal, Homo habilis, Homo erectus, etc. could have migrated *TO* Africa from other parts of the world and there made the evolutionary advancement to Homo sapien which eventually migrated out of Africa.

As a theory this would seem to support both ideas that ""humanity didn't originate in Africa, but Homo sapien - current humans - did.""Geographic origin of humanity?",edit lot reference made homo sapiens think might confused use word human say homo sapien human earlier hominins including members genus homo probably something discussed death happens frequently issue got first came political discussion r southafrica spent last days arguing geneticist never even interest field first one say next idea talking field someone argument mentioned africa hypothesis fact heard debunked went looking info found incredible fairly old article https wakeup world com dna evidence debunks africa theory human evolution debunks article suggests current data disproves idea humanity originated africa haplotypes found ever close identical african match sum article basically says best guess humanity originated australia pretty certain genetic evidence humanity genesis africa continuing argue point r southafrica frankly irrelevant discussion went smithsonian museum natural history http humanorigins si edu evidence human family tree found page human family tree alleges sahelanthropus tchadensis oldest known ancestor modern humans lived sometime million years ago west central africa chad seems contradict information first article linked evidence claim species lived claim made found cranial material species africa specifically refer homo sapien ignore earlier evolution human animal africa assertion humanity originated africa period like qualify last question article https wakeup world com dna evidence debunks africa theory human evolution linked seems pretty iron clad analysis arrives fact human race originate africa wonder africa model makes distinction homo sapien originating africa meaning neandertal homo habilis homo erectus etc could migrated africa parts world made evolutionary advancement homo sapien eventually migrated africa theory would seem support ideas humanity originate africa homo sapien current humans geographic origin humanity

I brought it up with one doctor and she had no idea what I was talking about nor wanted to pursue looking into it for me.

This is all dandy until 2 seizures, 5 blackouts, fever, vomiting, and doctors telling you it's something you probably did or denying it happened. Then it gets a bit more complicated than 'take it and find out'.
So I decided to find a consumer based test and it stated I had no function in cyp2c19 and only one good copy for some other ones. Almost all of the drugs I was prescribed are substrates of cyp2c19 and I had a very bad reaction to all of them, where as other medications I had that did not fall into this I didn't have sever side effects with. I brought it up with my doctor again and he said it was just an invalid correlation with causation on my part. He said the consumer dna tests are a joke. (I got raw data from labcorp).

The F1 generation is then crossed in several different ways to give a variety of phenotypes in the F2 generation, representing a range between wild and crop species, that can then be scored. The markers that are genetically linked to QTL that influence the phenotypic difference between parental lines segregate more frequently with the trait values, but unlinked markers will not show this association.""

660,trilla94,1520202812.0,8216f3,10,genetics,"So I'm a 24 year old Vietnamese American that has always experienced flushing or Asian glow while drinking alcohol. I, like so many others, take Pepcid before drinking to mitigate the symptoms and tone down the redness, but nonetheless I still turn at least pink when I drink. If I drink without Pepcid, I'll turn extremely red, and it's extremely embarassing. Regardless, I used to still drink while I was in college and was able to enjoy myself and I always felt like my body would process the alcohol fine, I would sober up fast and I virtually NEVER had a hangover or alcohol withdrawals. Honestly, if it wasn't for the visual problem of my face turning red, I never felt like I experienced any worse effects to alcohol as my friends did. I did get buzzed faster than everyone, but when it came to binge drinking, I was just like everyone else, if anything my body processed it well after the initial flushing and I was usually the one good enough to take care of everyone else by the end of the night. I had a generally above average tolerance to alcohol and always wake up fine the next day, and always felt fine. Never had a bad hangover, or really feel hungover at all. It was just the flushing that made alcohol embarassing, so I just took Pepcid to alleviate the flushing as best I could and continued drinking to maintain part of my social life. 

I recently heard about a company called Delta Nutraessentials that supposedly helps those that are suffering with Asian glow. My understanding is that many Asians like myself are ALDH2 deficient. My understanding is that most people's bodies convert Alcohol into a acetaldehyde, which is toxic and causes flushing, and then have ALDH2 converts that into acetate, which is harmless to the body. Since many Asians dont have the ALDH2 enzyme, acetaldehyde accumulates into the body and causes flushing and also increases our risk for cancer and esophageal cancer since it is a toxin. The pills supposedly help the body produce ALDH2 and process acetaldehyde which is better than Pepcid because all Pepcid does is mask the flushing but doesn't prevent the buildup of the toxin in the body which can be damaging in the long run. 

So anyways, I ordered the pills and the site also gives you the opportunity to take a genetic test related to Alcohol Tolerance that tests your ability to produce ALDH2 as well as if you're at risk for alcoholism in the future in a 4 part test. I've always wanted to do a genetic test and I was curious as to wether or not I was at risk of becoming an alcoholic since my father was an alcoholic and there was a history of alcoholism in parts of my family. Since there was a deal for the test, I decided to order the test through Orig3n for only $30. 

I got the test results back a few days ago and I'm kind of confused by the results. I thought I was for sure going to test positive for an ALDH2 deficiency, but I was just curious to see what the results of the other categories for Alcohol Tolerance were. This is what I got, with what they wrote:

GABRA2 (Heavy Drinking) - CC
People with CC:
This result is found in 15% of the population. With this result, you may be more prone to excessive alcohol use and alcoholism. You may tend to be more impulsive, too.

SLC6A3 (Alcohol Withdrawal): CT
You are among 25% of the population. With this result, you are less susceptible to alcohol withdrawal.

SLC6A4 (Heavy Drinking): CA
You are among the 35% of the population. You are not likely to be as heavy a drinker as those with AA results

ALDH2 (Alcohol Tolerance): GG
You are in the 90% majority of the population that have the GG form. With GG, you can breakdown alcohol and therefore likely do not have the alcohol flush response. Most non-Asians
are ""GG"". Your ability to breakdown alcohol is normal, if you enjoy consuming alcohol, do so in moderate amounts. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, moderate drinking is up
to 1 drink per day for women and up to 2 drinks per day for men.

I'm not surprised by the first 3 results. It says I can be impulsive when drinking (which I am) and that I have a higher chance of heavy drinking but I do not have alcohol withdrawals (which I don't)

What I AM surprised by is that it says that I do not have an ALDH2 deficiency, not even one mutation, but both genes are fine. Which should mean that I don't flush, or most likely shouldn't, but I still do anyways. How is this so? Is there something else in my genes that is making me flush? Or are the test results wrong?

I do flush extremely fast and then after a while of drinking, my body kind of adjusts to it, is it possible that my ALDH2 gene to process acetaldehyde is fine but my ADH1 gene just processes Alcohol to fast for it to keep up?

I know this seems trivial but I am curious because I've always been fascinated by genetic testing but the results it's providing me are confusing. 

Tl;dr : I get Asian glow so I don't process alcohol correctly but the genetic test says I have genes that do know how to process it

Statistical Genetics is a scientific field concerned with the development and application of statistical methods for drawing inferences from genetic data. The term is most commonly used in the context of human genetics. Statistical genetics is an area at the convergence of genetics and quantitative analysis. Over the last few years it has experienced a drastic shift of paradigm, from a mostly Statistical Methods in Genetics theoretical subject with little room for empirical evidence to a heavily data-oriented discipline where the existence of large repositories of genetic data allows researchers to generate and explore new scientific hypotheses Statistical Methods in Genetics.

The question naturally arises: why were they then out-competed by Sapiens? 

The primary difference between both hominids (besides small morphological variations like chest cavity size, shoulder width, average height etc.) was  the Neanderthals’ relatively early introgression into Europe. I speculate this would have cut them off from larger migratory and settlement networks leading back to Africa that Sapiens had at their disposal. This would have given Sapiens an advantage with more extensive trade networks and resource diversification. On the other hand, Neanderthals, by isolating themselves in Northern Europe, would have also cut themselves off from miscegenation with the larger subpopulation of Sapien groups, missing out on opportunities of establishing wider tribal alliances. 

Any thoughts?

If there's a better subreddit to ask this, please let me know.

My 10 month old baby was born with an extra toe on one foot, which is webbed the the adjoining toe. This isn't an issue, is only looks slightly abnormal and our doc mentions it's reasonably common and the risks of surgery on an infant outweigh the negligible (if any) affect this will have on his life.

But here's my question: I also have webbed toes (on both feet) that obviously share commonality with my son's toe. It's slightly different though, I don't believe I have any additional toes, just the last two toes are webbed together on each foot. It has never been an issue of any kind for me.

So the obvious conclusion is that this is some genetic abnormality passed down, right? Except it can't be - I have an identical twin brother and he doesn't have any deformation of any kind on either of his feet. He is my genetic identical and doesn't carry any signs of this. So I spent my entire life believing it's simply an environmental cause in the womb that led to my malformation.

So is there a genetic component, or were me and my son both just lucky to have the same (well, similar) deformation, or was it related to genetics in some way?

Mostly this is about my curiosity.

Here are two pictures, one of his foot and one of mine. Sorry I took pictures of opposite feet - both of my feet look the same, but my son's right foot is completely normal.

729,kakarrott,1517936604.0,7voqzi,4,genetics,"Hello there, 

I want to ask you guys about this branch of medicine. I found it quite recently and there seems to be quite a little info about it. Most of the information I found was here in years old threads, so I decided that hopefully, I can get some new perspectives and insights.

My first question obviously is if this is still a thing if I can be interested in Medical Genetics and find a job in a 10 years span. (If I can do it all). 

My second question is quite obvious too, which route is the best one. In those threads, I mentioned I found some possibilities to be.

Pediatrics - Neonatal - Geneticist
IM/Genetics combined 
Pediatrics/Genetics combined
Ob/Gyn + Genetics combined

Is this still a thing or has something changed? Any route better than a previous, I mean competence wise, length is not a problem for me. 

My third question is really more like the need for confirmation. 

Most of the people on the internet mentioned that Genetics is a field that has everything that's for me interesting. It combines detective work because each genetic patient is unique. It combines that I would most likely know my patients for quite some time because it isn't something that can be done in a span of weeks. You get to treat, or take care of and diagnose, NICU patients (I am no weirdo or creep but there is something incredibly rewarding and interesting on treating (anyhow helping) those who cannot do anything themselves. There is some hero factor in it). You get to see cancer (which is also very interesting). And there is always a room for research. 
Basically, I think it is very challenging, not repeating (kinda allergic to boredom... repetitiveness) specialty that needs some scientific proficiency. 

this is what I find interesting from what I know or thing, can you please tell me if I am wrong somewhere or if there's, even more, I can do? 

My last question is just out of curiosity. I understand that what I am asking is hardly possible and even if it is possible it would be incredibly hard but I am gonna ask anyway  

Naturally, Genetics isn't the only thing I am interested in, but it seems that my Interest generally is in human body disorders. Genetics, Immunology, and Endocrinology are what interests me most (besides Cancer). So basically my question is if those areas can be somehow combined in one practice. I feel like it is somehow connected but I am not sure if one man can do more than one of those (or maybe all of them.) But as I said this is more out of curiosity than anything else because that's how I see it now.

Anyway, thank you guys who have red it all the way here. It means a lot to me.. Thank you in advance for any insight.

ps. Someone back then (this time on old Reddit post) mentioned that there are/were many branches of genetics (Lysosomal Disorders, Cancer Genetics, Cardiovascular Congenital Disorders etc.) so I wondered if you like, have to choose one and dive deep into that or if you can, like, switch between them, or meet patients with every type of disorder and not just the one you are deep into.

I'm wondering how anyone's experience has been when having testing done for genetic mutations and their feelings about the results, whether the results were positive or negative. 

My mom passed away from breast cancer that was diagnosed before the age of 50. She had no blood siblings and I only have one sister, I'm 26 and she's 30. My old doctor felt like those two risk factors alone weren't enough to go on to bother with a BRCA test. He more or less told me since there's no extensive family history it's not worth it (without acknowledging there is no real history for me to study either way). I have an appointment with a new doctor and intend to be firm in requesting it again. 

I'm concerned with how I'll take the news no matter the results though. My experience growing up with a terminally ill parent has impacted my adult life as one can imagine, right down to choosing not to have children (in case I got sick). The test could help me to live more fully. But has anyone gotten a negative and still remained fearful of an impending diagnosis?

737,Yona168,1517714010.0,7v49af,5,genetics,"Hey everyone, I’m a sophomore in high school, and pretty soon I’m going to be part of a debate where the question is if scientists should genetically modify humans. I’m arguing the “yes” side. The main topic I wish to know more about is this:

-If we allow scientists to genetically modify humans, and that becomes commercial use for anyone for anything, couldn’t the higher-income classes pay for the “good traits,” further worsening inequality? Won’t there be humans with “good” genes and humans with “bad” ones, and couldn’t that prompt discrimination?

My argument against this is:

-Given the potential disaster, it is possible that this could happen. However, given the ethical discussions around it, it seems, if it does grow, that ethical panels would draw lines of where it is ok to modify humans and where it isn’t, which would effectively prevent any sort of ethical catastrophe. In a similar vein, couldn’t anything be used for both good and bad? For example, drugs that are for medicinal use are banned in most places. While the rule isn’t enforced as much as it should be, I feel as if the problems that commercially genetically modifying humans are so severe that it will be controlled strictly.

Is there some further convincing proof to what I’m saying? If not, is there a way to argue pro commercially offering genetic modifications? 

I hope that this thread will help me, but I hope more that it will prompt some interesting discussion, which is why I added the “discussion” flair. Thanks!

739,Teh_Adda,1517589688.0,7usjmo,7,genetics,"Sorry if this question has come up in some form but I wasn't able to find anything so here we go:

To clarify I am no expert and only have school education on the topic of genetics. During discussions with some ""conservatives"" I stumbled across a common argument that ""people with different skin color have different genes, so they have different skills/attributes than white people"" (paraphrasing).

Now I know that two humans can not be genetically identical but the DNA of one human being is 99,5% similar to another human being. 

So for example if I take two white (caucasian) people and on the other hand one white and one black person and compare the genetic variance. One could assume that the variance in the latter example is bigger than in the first example but is this necessarily true? Could the genetic variance between two caucasian people be bigger then between a black and a white person?

740,Tiredness,1517523259.0,7umj3b,3,genetics,"Hello all,

About a month ago I got my 23andMe report back. In addition to this, I uploaded the data onto Promethease and Genetic Genie to look more into the health aspect of things.

While much of it is pretty straightforward, I am still left with many questions about my genes. Some of it seems contradictory and other aspects leave me with a lot of concern. The main issue is that I know only the sheer basics of genetics and much of the report goes waaay over my head. 

I know that these reports are not an offical diagnosis or a guarantee that a gene will ""express"" itself, but I would like to utilize my report as much as possible to better my health. 

I was wondering if geneticists will commonly analyze reports such as these and combine it with patient health information to get a better idea of which genes may truly be causing issues? I feel seeing a professional can put my mind at ease and confirm/debunk whether or not I should be concerned about certain genes (such as numerous genes saying I have a x% increased risk of y cancer). Any input or anecdotal experiences with geneticists is greatly appreciated.

Here's what I'm trying to do: I work with a particular protein, and recently a new organism was discovered and its genome sequenced. I want to see if any of the newly discovered protein sequences have any similarity to my protein's sequence. I have all of the new organism's protein fasta sequences in one file. I was wondering if there exist any online programs that will take the file and attempt to align each individual sequence to my protein's sequence. This sounds like BLAST, however I've never had much luck with BLAST in the past. If BLAST is what I want, do you have any tips?
